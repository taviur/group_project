   <p>You might be finishing uni in a year, or you might be having your last exam tomorrow, or you might already be finished, and you might just be thinking... <b>what the fuck do I do after uni?</b> Well, hopefully we can give you a bit of help! (or at least a bit of reassurance, after all, we went through the post-uni trauma and we got out alright, didn't we?)</p>
    <p>Now, we've chopped up the post-uni pathways into three beautiful little sections: <a name="study">Study More</a>, join the <a name="work">World of Work</a>, or do <a name="something_else">Something Else</a> completely bloody different! <p>There's also a cheeky little blog full of useful links, slightly less useful links, hints & tips we have no idea where to put and a bunch of other stuff we'd just like you to read!</p>
      <p>And don't forget to check out our handy little submission form plonked at the end of this page if you've got any tips of your own & a sign up form for our monthly newsletter full of sensational, sexual & simply super tips of the month from ourselves and our mates.</p>
   <p>So gwan & enjoy the advice you scallywags!</p>
   <a name="study"><h2>Study More</h2></a>
   <p>You may be addicted to learning, which is great (you nerd! no really, learning is great) so maybe you're thinking about taking a Masters or a PhD and wondering how the fuck that whole ting even works, because lord knows we had no bloody clue.</p>
   <br>
<p>First off, we'll define post-study study as 'taught courses' and 'research courses' because as we struggled to find out, not all master programmes are made the same.

   <h3>Taught Courses</h3>
   <br>
   <p>A taught course means, well, you'll be taught more things! You can take a Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc) or Master of Business Administration (MBA).</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Research Courses</h3>
   <br>
   <p>A research course means... you'll be researching stuff! You can take a Masters research course or a PhD. 
  <br>
   <a name="work"><h2>World of Work</h2></a>
   <h3>Blimey, now this is a hard one...</h3>
   <p> Whether you want to get onto a graduate scheme, or you want to just jump in and figure out what you actually want to do later - there's definitely going to be something out there for you!<p>
    Websites like <a href="https://www.wikijob.co.uk/">WikiJobs</a> will help you narrow down the right graduate job for you.
    Whereas recruitment companies like <a href="http://www.reed.co.uk/">Reed.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.indeed.co.uk/">Indeed</a> will give you a broader look at what's out there and match you with some employers.</p>
   <br>
    <a name="something_else"><h2>Something Else</h2></a>
   <p> You may not want to work, or study more, you may be undecided, but that's all cool - you've got plenty of time mate!</p>
   <br>
   <p> Some other things you can do could be: travel the world, start up your own company, take a couple internships, get temporary work, volunteer for something you believe in, become a stand up comedian, organise activist marches, or anything you want really.</p>

   <h3>Travel The World</h3>
