   <h2>Study More</h2>
   <br>
   <p>You may be addicted to learning, which is great (you nerd! no really, learning is great) so maybe you're thinking about taking a Masters or a PhD and wondering how the fuck that whole ting even works, because lord knows we had no bloody clue.</p>
   <br>
<p>First off, we'll define post-study study as 'taught courses' and 'research courses' because as we struggled to find out, not all master programmes are made the same.

   <h3>Taught Courses</h3>
   <br>
   <p>A taught course means, well, you'll be taught more things! You can take a Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc) or Master of Business Administration (MBA).</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Research Courses</h3>
   <br>
   <p>A research course means... you'll be researching stuff! You can take a Masters research course or a PhD.
